{"name":"Mockrunner","tagline":"Mock classes for enterprise application testing","body":"### Welcome to the new Mockrunner joint.\r\nThis is an evolution of the [original](http://mockrunner.sourceforge.net) Mockrunner project founded by Alwin Ibba in 2003. Same source but now with a new home and a new shape.\r\n\r\nWe reorganized the project into a maven structure and are now deploying release versions to the maven central repository.\r\n\r\n### Mockrunner Modules\r\nMockrunner has been split into modules so that you don't have to pull all the dependencies if you only want to use one type of mock objects.\r\n\r\nList of available modules:\r\n\r\n* mockrunner-jms\r\n* mockrunner-ejb\r\n* mockrunner-jdbc\r\n* mockrunner-jca\r\n* mockrunner-servlet\r\n* mockrunner-tag\r\n* mockrunner-struts\r\n* mockrunner-all\r\n\r\n### Key References\r\n\r\nThe Mockrunner maven site [here](http://mockrunner.github.io/mockrunner) has detailed technical information about the project and it's modules. You'll find javadoc and usage examples too.\r\n\r\nThe Mockrunner project repository is [here](https://github.com/mockrunner/mockrunner). Come in and be social.\r\n\r\n### Download Mockrunner?\r\nNo need to download mockrunner if you have a maven project. Just add a dependency you want to use, such as JMS in the example below:\r\n \r\n```\r\n<groupId>com.mockrunner</groupId>\r\n<artifactId>mockrunner-jms</artifactId>\r\n<version>${mockrunner-version}</version>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMockrunner releases include jar, sources, javadoc and tests for every module. See the lastest release on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.mockrunner%22).\r\n\r\nOf course, if you must download the artifacts manually, you can do so directly from sonatype at http://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/mockrunner\r\n\r\n### Suggestions and Bug reporting\r\nPlease use git [issues](https://github.com/mockrunner/mockrunner/issues) on the mockrunner repository to report any issues, or ask for new features. Your suggestions and contributions are most welcome.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2003, Alwin Ibba (@ibbaa) founded Mockrunner together with Jeremy Whitlock and Gábor Lipták. With web design contributions from Jeremy Whitlock and Nick Myers, they set up the project on sourceforge.\r\nMockrunner became very popular registering a great deal of interest from the developer community and a fair amount of weekly downloads.\r\n\r\nBob McCune has written an excellent [article](https://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/09/13/container-free-testing-with-mockrunner.html) on Mockrunner.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 Steiner Bang (@steinarb) brought the code to Github and Carlos Martins (@cemartins) reshaped it into a multi-module maven project. Carlos was later promoted to project lead and main developer.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at http://mockrunner.github.io/mockrunner or contact cemartins@mockrunner.com and we’ll help you sort it out.","google":"UA-36088259-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
